    <h2>How Requirements are Met</h2>
    <p>
      - The initial idea is a smart heating system, although it is represented through
      LEDs (Light Emitting Diode) in a breadboard. Therefore, it is focused on the
      main idea of this project. <br />
      - An embedded system, the MicroL:bit, is used to control the PIR/ motion sensor
      and the LEDs. The LEDs are triggered by the motion sensor.<br />
      - Thereâ€™s a connection between the embedded system and the website (through
      Firebase and Python). Therefore, it allows the user to interact with the system.
      <br />
      - In reality, it gives a visual presentation of the benefits of having a smart
      heating system as it is cost efficient and energy saving. It solves the issue
      with heatings being turnt on for the whole house and not just one room.

    <p>
      Luckily enough, I had all the right equipment in school. <br />
      My project consisted of : <br />
      - A PIR sensor (motion) <br />
      - LEDs <br />
      - Breadboard <br />
      - Crocadile Clips <br />
      - Male to Male wires <br />
      - Male to female wires.
