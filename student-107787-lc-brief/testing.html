    <h2>Iteration One:</h2>
    <p>
      For Iteration One, I mainly focused on the design and layout aspect of the
      project, i.e., the company website. I have developed a website that mimics a
      company that supplies heating systems for smart homes. I have created a
      navigation bar that consists of four pages related to the company itself. The
      following pages are: <br />
      <br />
      THE HOME PAGE: <br />
      - I have developed a home page that provides information for the user/viewer.
      <br />
      - A color scheme of red, gold and white is developed for the website.<br />
      - A logo called Cozy Homes to show that we supply services to homeowners.
      <br />
      - Users can easily navigate through the website due to the navigation bar I have
      developed, linking the three other pages. <br />
      - A short and direct piece of information about the company and what it provides
      is added to the home page, along with a picture to stand for the goal of the
      company. <br />
      <br />
      THE LOGIN PAGE: <br />
      - One of the pages I have developed was the login page. <br />
      - The page mimics a login form that asks users to provide a username/email
      address and a password. <br />
      - If the user is new, there’s a link to access the signup form where users can
      enter their name, username/email address and password. Thus, mimicking that a
      user has created a new account. <br />
      - The logo Cozy Homes is added to the page as a link to go back to the home page
      if users want to exit out of the login page. <br />
      <br />
      THE PRODUCTS AND CONTACTS PAGE: <br />
      The links to these pages have been created but I haven’t designed nor thought
      what should be in those pages yet. I hope to have them developed and completed
      before this whole project is due.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives of Iteration Two</h2>
    <p>
      Before Iteration Two is due, I hope to focus more on the Micro: bit, Firebase
      and Python aspect of the project, more than the development and the complete
      design of the website. My aim is to: <br />
      - Start working on the Micro: bit to develop a physical representation of the
      heating system. <br />

      - Set up Firebase and develop a way to connect it to the Micro: bit and the
      website. <br />

      - Develop a code for Firebase to store the new users and their own usernames,
      passwords and status of heating systems. <br />

      - Have the submit function of the login page to work and connect to Firebase,
      storing their information. <br />

      - Develop a way for users to input their optimal temperatures and control the
      heating system through their account on the website I.e., turn off and on.
    </p>

    <h2>Iteration Two:</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the website is composed and completed. Pictures have been added and
      consistency of color scheme is set up throughout the whole website itself.
      <br />
      <br />
      CONTACTS PAGE: <br />
      It has been fully developed. It consists of: <br />
      - An embedded Google maps for location of the said company<br />
      - A small contacts box which includes the address, the phone number and email
      address of the said company.<br />
      - It almost mimics a company page. <br />
      <br />
      THE LOGIN PAGE:
      <br />The functionality of this page has been set up. Though, I wasn’t able to
      create a functioning login or sign up due to the time.
      <br />
      - Instead, I assigned a username and password in my code to get everything done
      in time. <br />
      - The sign-up has now become a display for the website itself and the login is
      what the user is going to use along with its assigned username and password.
      <br />
      <br />
      SET UP OF DATABASE AND COMMUNICATION:<br />
      The database (Firebase and Python) to which the website communicates through to
      the embedded system, the Micro:bit has been fully developed. <br />
      - At the moment, the user can interact with the website in their own account, by
      turning on and turning off the heating system, represented by LEDs.
      <br />
      - It functions as it is sending a value of One to the Firebase and Python to
      show that there is communication between the database and website.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives of Final Iteration:</h2>
    <p>
      Before the final iteration is due, I hope to have the Micro:bit developed and
      coded to its functionality in time. I am focusing on making sure the connection
      between the website to Firebase and Python to the embedded system is fully
      developed and working well.
      <br />
      I will also be focusing on the completion of the website and small tasks to
      fulfill the requirements of this project.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Iteration:</h2>

    <p>
      Website it fully developed with 4 HTML pages fully connected and designed
      through a navigation bar. <br />
      The 4 HTML pages: Home page, Contacts Page, Product Page, and the Login page
      connected to its account. <br />
      The connection between website to database to the embedded system is completed
      and functioning well. Can be seen through the video. <br />
      <br />
      WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ADDED IN:<br />
      Due to the limited time, I wasn’t able to develop the function for the embedded
      system to receive a value for the ‘optimal temperature’ if the user wanted to
      change it through their account.<br />
      - A scroller was inputted as the range for the temperature into the account page
      but I had to undo that because of the time. <br />
      - Originally the website had the ‘optimal temperature’ value functioning since
      it was communicating through the database and then through system that connects
      the embedded system. <br />
      - However, I wasn’t able to fully develop the Micro:bit to receive that value
      due to time so instead, the user can only turn off and turn on the embedded
      system
