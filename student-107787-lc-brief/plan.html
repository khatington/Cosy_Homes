    <h1>Plan</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Initial Ideas</h2>
    <p>
      - A heating system which relies on motion sensors detecting whether someone is
      present in the room or not. If detected, the heating for that certain room will
      turn on instead of the whole heating in the house. <br />
      - Automatic timed curtains that close at a certain time, instead of having the
      customer close the curtains in any room.<br />
      - Timed sprinklers in a garden, decide whether it has rained or not, customers
      will not have to water their gardens.
    </p>

    <h2>Chosen Idea</h2>
    <p>
      The chosen idea was the heating system as every home has a source of heating.
      Heating is an essential part of the home as it makes what a home to be a home,
      bringing the cosiness aspect of a home.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantages of this idea:</h2>
    <p>
      - It is energy efficient as it only heats up rooms that are being used. <br />

      - Minimizes the excess use of heating overnight. <br />

      - It is stress free as the homeowner themselves do not have to manually turn the
      heating at a particular time of the day. <br />

      - Smart heating systems can regulate the temperature to prevent harsh weather
      conditions affecting the home while you are out abroad.
    </p>

    <h2>Disadvantages of this idea:</h2>

    <p>
      - Possibilities of sensors malfunctioning causing heating in a room to be
      dysfunctional.<br />

      - Smart systems are prone to be hacked at any time depending on if the system
      supplies tight security, such as a password. <br />

      - The cost of upgrading into a smart heating system is quite expensive. <br />

      - Since it is digital and automatic, it is internet dependent and dependent on
      professionals to fix it if problems have arisen.
    </p>

    <h2>Identified Stakeholders:</h2>

    <p>
      - Customers/homeowners <br />

      - Employees <br />

      - Investors <br />

      - Property owners <br />

      - Real estate Agents <br />

      - Interior Designers <br />

      - Other professions relating to home designing and construction.
    </p>

    <h2>Identified End Users:</h2>

    <p>
      Customers/ Homeowners investing in smart heating systems for their homes. To
      meet a favourable condition in their own homes.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives of Design:</h2>

    <p>
      To design and create a heating system where each room of a smart home is
      provided with its own motion sensor and heating in place. The functionality of
      this heating system relies on the motion sensors to detect whether someone is
      present in the room, triggering the usage of heating only in that room. Another
      function is that the heating will turn off once the room has reached an optimal
      temperature, preventing an excess usage of heat. A solution to when someone goes
      in and out of a room Another function is for the user to be able to change the
      optimal temperature of the heating system through their own account through web.
