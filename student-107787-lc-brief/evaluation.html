    <h1>Evaluation</h1>

    <h2>Overall Conclusion:</h2>

    <p>
      In my opinion, I enjoyed and hated this project simultaneously throughout the
      whole development. As the student, I feel accomplished to see that my skills,
      gained from previous projects/ ALTs and hard work, have been tested to its
      potential in this project. I am contented with what I have and finished
      regardless of what I could have done more to make it better. It was a nice
      project to work on.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it meet requirements:</h2>

    <p>
      - The website is fully connected to the embedded system (the Micro: bit). <br />

      - You’re able to control the LEDs / heating system through the website itself.
      <br />

      - A visual presentation of the website is there to nearly mimic a company
      website. <br />

      - The values of the LED status can be seen in the database, which ensures that
      the right value is inputted and displayed and that there is a connection between
      the website and the embedded system.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>How are the needs of the end user met:</h2>

    <p>
      - Clear information and instructions are given to the user on the website and in
      their account, therefore, it won’t be difficult or confusing for the user to
      understand. <br />

      - ALT text is added to any pictures on the website if the user is unable to see
      them. <br />

      - User can control the ‘heating system’ through their account by the click of a
      button. <br />

      - In the account, transition of colors and pictures are used to present the user
      that the button is either turned off or on. <br />

      - A navigation bar is set up; therefore, users can go through the website
      quickly and clearly. <br />

      - A login is used for the user to input their username and password. <br />

      - If username and password is wrong, Users will be alerted to ‘try again’.
      <br />

      - Pages such as home, contacts and products have been designed to give
      information to the user.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>What went well:</h2>

    <p>
      - The overall design of the website; I enjoyed the CSS and HTML aspect of this
      project in general even though it was stressful. <br />

      - The setting up of the LEDs, breadboard etc. <br />

      - The connection between the database and the website went well unexpectedly.
      <br />

      - Due to previous projects/ ALTs that I have done in the past LC year, I was
      happy that I am familiar with what I had to do in the website aspect, the
      database connection aspect and the setting up of LEDs and breadboard aspect.
      Along with implementing the embedded system (the Micro: bit) to work with.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>What went wrong:</h2>

    <p>
      - Overall, my time management wasn’t up to par as I could’ve been able to add
      the ‘optimal temperature’ value in my website and embedded system. <br />

      - I spent some time fixing the connection of the database to the embedded system
      instead due to a lot of errors. <br />

      - It was difficult to know whether equipment like the PIR sensors were working
      or if they’re broken. <br />

      - A lot of my time was spent on the website; the HTML pages of my website would
      break, and I would have to inspect the web to find the cause of the errors.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>What could I have changed to if I had gone back or had more time:</h2>

    <p>
      - One thing I would want to do is to add that ‘optimal temperature’ input in my
      website and implement it into the Micro: bit. <br />

      - Have the login and sign-up page to be more sophisticated instead of assigning
      a username and password. <br />

      - In general, planning and time management would’ve been consistent if I were to
      do it again.
