# LC_Project
My end of the Year Leaving Cert project for computer science. 
Smart and Sustainability was the theme of the project. The criteria was to create a company website that sells 'smart products' for smart homes. 
The idea of my website focused on smart heating systems using motion sensors, to avoid a wasting electricity and gas. Instead of turning on the heating for the whole house, motion sensors would be triggered in rooms only being used.
