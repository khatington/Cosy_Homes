## Cosy Homes üè†
Leaving Cert. project for Computer Science. <br/>
Theme: Sustainability with Smart home systems. <br/>

### Criteria 
- Create a comapny website that sells 'smart home products' with a functioning user account connected to database (Firebase). 
- Create a physical prototype demonstrating the smart product using Micro:bits
- Achieve connection between user account and interaction with Micro:bits, demonstrating simultaneous updates occuring in database.

### The project
Focused on the idea of smart heating systems using motion sensors to avoid over consumption of electricity and gas within the house. Instead of turning on the heating for the entire house, why not implement motions sensors that trigger the heating system in only occupied rooms.  

- `Cosy homes`: the company website which includes details of the company, the location, the products and the user login. `index.html` is the home page of this website. 
- `Micro:Bit_Program.js`: the functionality for the Micro:Bit, PIR sensors and LEDs.
- `tester LED.py`: the code to establish connection between user account and `Firebase`
